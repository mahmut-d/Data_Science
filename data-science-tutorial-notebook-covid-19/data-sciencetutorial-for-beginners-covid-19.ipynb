Basic Tools: Like python, R or SQL. You do not need to know everything. What you only need is to learn how to use **python**\n1. Basic Statistics: Like mean, median or standart deviation. If you know basic statistics, you can use **python** easily. \n1. Data Munging: Working with messy and difficult data. Like a inconsistent date and string formatting. As you guess, **python** helps us.\n1. Data Visualization: Title is actually explanatory. We will visualize the data with **python** like matplot and seaborn libraries.\n1. Machine Learning: You do not need to understand math behind the machine learning technique. You only need is understanding basics of machine learning and learning how to implement it while using **python**.\n\n### As a summary we will learn python to be data scientist !!!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/covid_19_data.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.corr()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#correlation map\nf,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,16))\nsns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot=True, linewidths=.5, fmt= '.1f', ax=ax)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### MATPLOTLIB\n\nMatplot is a python library that help us to plot data.
